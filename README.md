# React Note Taking App with Local Storage

This project is a simple note-taking app built with React and designed to store notes locally using browser's local storage API.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need Node.js installed on your machine. Once Node.js is installed, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project from the GitHub repository:



2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd react-note-taking-app


3. Install dependencies:

npm install


4. Start the development server:

npm start


5. Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to see the app.

## Usage

To use the note-taking app, simply enter a note into the input field and click the "Add" button. The note will be added to the list of notes displayed on the page.

You can edit or delete a note by clicking the corresponding buttons next to the note. The edited note will replace the old one in the list, and the deleted note will be removed.

The app uses the browser's local storage API to store notes, so your notes will still be available even if you close the browser or shut down your computer.
